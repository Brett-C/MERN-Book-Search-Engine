# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

[Link to App]()

## Description

This application uses MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) stack to run a books api made by google. The user is able to create an account and search for a particular title, and save it to their profile. They are able to click on the title and it will open up a description of the book. If they go to their saved books they can see a list of what books they have saved for later from the main search page.
